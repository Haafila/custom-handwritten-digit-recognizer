# custom-handwritten-digit-recognizer
🚀 This is a simple deep learning project that predicts handwritten digits (0–9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can draw a digit or upload an image, and the app will identify the digit in real-time.

## 💡 Features

- 🖌️ Draw a digit on the screen
- 📤 Upload your own digit image (28x28 grayscale)
- ⚙️ Model trained on MNIST dataset
- 🔮 Predicts digit with confidence
- 🎨 User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**

## 🧠 Model Building
   - Build a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense layers.
   - Used ReLU activation in hidden layers and Softmax for the output layer

---  

## 📊 Training & Evaluation 
   - Trained the model for 10 epochs on the MNIST dataset.
   - Evaluated accuracy on test data.
   - Visualized training vs validation loss and accuracy curves.
   - Generated a confusion matrix to analyze prediction performance.
